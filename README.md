This is the GUI source for the bsteeleMusicApp.
For usage, see http://www.bsteele.com or http://communityjams.org.

Note: Compilation requires the bsteeleMusicLib library available
at: http://github.com/pearlbob/bsteeleMusicLib. This provides the application
data model for the GUI.

The leader/follower feature
requires: https://github.com/pearlbob/bsteeleMusicServer that runs
in an Apache Tomcat server.
