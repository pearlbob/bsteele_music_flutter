# bsteeleMusicApp bug list and planning

# Release Planning:

## Release 1.2
### Release Date

### Features

* drum regularity
* Named drum parts attached to songs

### Fix

* follower countin not working
* make the user edit field a "regular" field so any change can be undo or saved. Update the field only if unknown.
* player: in pause, reposition play with up/down arrows or scroll,
  continue from new location with space bar hit
* And it seems to want to default to my last name change, rather than a default of my name - not sure if that is
  definable.
* visual delay on mac mini? Just off, slow. correct when measured post render.
* explain storage. Yes
* Mute button? Display and keyboard shortcut
* regenerate generated metadata after editing
* playlist: change of screen from menu item, change of order, or change of filter should focus on the empty search text


## Fixes Completed

* count-in drums and indicator on autoplay
* verify/fix auto playback timing and jitter
* Back to player from song preview on youtube.com, fullscreen button missing
* Improved startup delay based on history. More is required.
* generate Decade, time signature, key, bpm metadata from the song's year... programmatically.
* drums on 2/4, 3/4, 6/8
* drums in the background while in "manual play" mode. that is, things as they typically are now with drums playing but
  not auto advance nor any indication of the current measure. basically a replacement for your foot pedals.
* browser reload on subsequent pages
* find the closest songId for history songs without non-null song
* Beta fails on song title change from history
* Shari UI: the listed key disappears once you are in play mode
* singer mode: no capo!

# Bugs

### Shari UI stuff:

* Shari UI: 3 compress/expand modes:  compressed, expanded, as transcribed
* Shari UI: easy move from player to singer
* Shari UI: the back button doesn't take you to where you just were in the list ( mostly fixed )
* Shari UI: When one clicks a play button at the top left and then suddenly doesn't see a stop button next to it
* Shari UI: two back buttons
* Shari UI: buttons too close
* Shari UI: scroll to chord line on scroll
* Shari UI: aim a little low on a large section ie. always show next section first row (approximate)
* Shari UI: more on follower display when leader is not playing a song
* Any way to allow zoom on play screen so one might read the lyrics?
* Browsing our list is super unfriendly without sorting function
* If the phone version cannot be user-friendly, I suggest we redirect users to a webpage like the searchable,
  sortable Beginner list generated from the spreadsheet. http://communityjams.org/index.php/beginner-jam-song-list/

### Shari:

* Bb/CCX Bb/CCX - two beats of Bb and a stab on the C. But the app insists on adding a dot to the Bb like this: Bb./CCX
  Bb./CCx Still can't put in the X after the C without it forcing a dot, but it will work.

I continue to have intermittent trouble if I have to scroll back up during the play mode. Here is the sequence:

1. First enter play mode, then use space bar to advance
2. After 1-3 space bar advances, manually scroll up, but not all the way to the top. It doesn't ever glitch if I go all
   the way back up.
3. Once I force it to scroll up to the top and play again, it doesn't seem to glitch again until I load another song.
4. This may take 2-4 attempts to break, not dependent on complexity.
5. It requires the scroll-up to break - never breaks if I simply play it straight through with the space bar.
1. If we normally use Player mode to play charts, there is no reason not to freeze the row of buttons at the top when
   not in Player mode.
   We can scan down the song and not have to scroll back and forth/up and down to determine where there are potential
   problems before performing.

2. Bodhi is swinging back to wanting some of the more musically dense songs charted in 2, which makes sense for
   readability and therefore playability.
   In fact, it would be nice if he could mark this type of timing edit in a special way, since it comes up more than
   other issues.
   Is there a way to mark the 'type' of edit - as in timing change versus content change?

3. I have a feeling I may need two sets of some charts, in 2 or 4, in case we need to move in the other direction as in
   the past.
   Is there a way to do this programmatically?

4. Technically, I have been looking at a lot of sheet music and most of our 2-time charts are not technically in 2/2 or
   2/4 (bouncy folk timing),
   so I suggest that the app should not specifically refer to "time signature" if we want to spread out the chords and
   make charts more jam-friendly.

It is difficult to find an alternative that does not confuse. One article I found refers to harmonic rhythm, but that is
too long a term.
https://www.ars-nova.com/Theory%20Q&A/Q5.html

I believe the most appropriate term for us to use is beats per measure, rather than time signature.
Since that confuses with the common term bpm (beats per minute), perhaps we can switch our bpm to "tempo" and switch our
time to "b/m"?
That would give us more freedom to chart songs with our desired simple beats per measure and not be limited by the
formal
and occasionally inaccurate use of "time signature."
With b/m, we might even add the elusive 3-5 to the list - the 3-5 beat pattern that is not actually a real time
signature but keeps coming up on songs without any reference on the chart.

I also try to keep tempo within the industry standards. Here is another reference for that:
https://songbpm.com/searches/ce40775f-0d09-496b-89c1-403d48591227

I need these types of guidelines so I am not forced to make arbitrary decisions while charting.
I am not clear how Bodhi calculates his tempo, but sometimes it is outside of these standards, so I will need to discuss
this with him.

5. We cannot obtain proper "Copyright" information so I suggest we name the field properly until we can.
   I suggest that we use the term "Credit" instead, rather than mislead the audience about copyright.

## New Features

* Bodhi's idea: Involves data and random numbers and games and music. And fun.
* personal list for individuals. by individuals from emailed lists to jam leader?
* singer mode: section title, first 3 measures then ellipsis
* roll list start when returning to song list vs back to the same location
* edit: paste from edit buffer
* Method to search library for desired songs: UI sketches

## Playful ideas

* song selection: name part name
* playing songs in wrong genre

  Not running in AOT mode but could not resolve the kernel binary.

* re-search main list on song file read

* triples in the drums
* show lists to followers (main and singer)

* button to adjust leader/follower when dis-connected

* F# and gb,. # override for guitar players (not persistent)
* notes for song transcriptions,
* pop songs from history list:  i.e. CJ top 40

* play tally off space bar: what? Do I have to pay attention?....
* freezing? do you mean always displaying the play button, key and beats per measure? capo is in that category. Bodhi
  wants to change bpm while in play.
* share the "sung by" in the follower update
* eliminate singer needs a song requirement

* improve player: Tap to tempo, follow space bar to beat 1

* edit lyrics: one blank row is now two? at section end?
* messages for file task completions or failures.
* mac native:  desktop app couldn't get I Shall Be Released to save in the key of E

* For me, key change creates a duplicate chart. And then looks like it keeps key change UNTIL you get rid of old
  version. Very weird.
* map accented characters to lower case without accent: "Exposé" should match "expose"   dart package diacritic

* research if the song id is case sensitive: e.g.: "I shall be released" vs "I Shall Be Released". YES!

* studio instructions for personal tablets

* lyrics for a section in one vertical block?
* verify blank lyrics lines force position in lyric sections
