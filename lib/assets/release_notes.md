## Release 1.2.6 Beta

### Release Date: TBD

* Available at: [beta](http://www.bsteele.com/bsteeleMusicApp/beta)

### Features

* Player scrolling moved to autoplay. See the play button tooltip for
  explanation.

### Fixes Completed

* History can filter by singer
* Dots above chords in the song display... but only when truly required. Periods are used as they used to be.
* In play, b (the studio switch) should advance one row, not a section.
* Section header labels small font
* Auto scroll to bumps by rows.
* Player now has: stop, play and pause. Pause is very close to the older manual mode.
* "Copyright" was changed to "release/label" on edit and player page
* Instrument pitch chart on the theory screen
* Fixed new song not always when selected from the main song list.
* Vertical alignment of menu items improved, icons still have an issue
* Youtube queries should not include the word "cover". This is generated by
  old songs with "cover by" in their title or artist.
* Player scrolling centered lower on the screen.
* Player scrolling moved to autoplay. See the play button tooltips for explanation.
* "Write All Metadata to CSV": fixed the metadata fields
* Pro Player display adjusted
* About screen overflow fixed
* "Copyright" changed to "Release/Label"
* Single 'm' key to tap to tempo
* Temp drums for tempo
* Stop scrolling if last is seen (tighten the bottom)
* Data on bpm during play pause
* "Get It On": section too large for autoscroll: autoroll like repeats are expanded: each lyric on grid row, hide
  chords if not on that repeat, current < top: show top, current > bottom: show bottom. The fix: Adjusted the fontsize
  to allow for more song to be seen.
