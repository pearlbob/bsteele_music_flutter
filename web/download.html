<h2>Web Version</h2>
<p>The bsteeleMusicApp is usually found on the web at
    <a href="http://www.bsteele.com/bsteeleMusicApp/index.html">bsteeleMusicApp</a>.
    This web version will be the most universal and easiest to use of the application formats.
</p>
<h2>Native Versions</h2>
<p>Native applications are also available.
    They are more difficult to install but will typically provide slightly better performance.
    Song list and song history updates are provided in the cloud so native applications
    should have access to the web for the best user experience.
</p>
<p>
    The following can be downloaded using the these links:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Macos x86 dmg: <a href="./bsteeleMusicApp.dmg" download>
        bsteeleMusicApp.dmg</a>. After downloading, verify the sha256sum as:
    </p>
        <p>
            <span id="dmgSha256sum"> </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Macos will not be happy about running an app downloaded from the web, but you can
            force it with: Apple icon, System Preferences, Security &amp; Privacy, "Allow apps
            downloaded
            from:", select the app to enable it. When re-installing the app, you will again
            have to force acceptance.
            If you still have security issues, try opening the app with a control click.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once installed, the app can be found in the system Applications folder labeled
            "bsteele_music_flutter.app".
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the application will automatically write the allSongPerformances file to the
            users home Download directory if the performances have been sung using the Singers
            screen and there has been roughly 45 minutes of no further action.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Android apk: <a href="./bsteeleMusicApp.apk" download>
            bsteeleMusicApp.apk</a>.
            After downloading, verify the sha256sum as:</p>
        <p>
            <span id="apkSha256sum"> </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Android will not willingly download and install apps from the web. Please research this
            and understand your security exposure. I suggest you start with
            <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-install-apks-31494/">androidauthority.com</a>.

        <p>Raspberry Pi aarch64: <a href="./bsteeleMusicAppPi.tgz" download>
            bsteeleMusicAppPi.tgz</a>.
            After downloading, verify the sha256sum as:</p>
        <p>
            <span id="piSha256sum"> </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            This tar file needs to be extracted to a convenient directory in a Raspberry Pi with a
            64 bit OS. The binary bsteele_music_flutter can be run in this directory.
            Note that it requires the lib and data directories be in their relative positions.
            Performance on a Pi 3 is marginal.
            Tested on Debian 11, bullseye OS on a Raspberry Pi 4. Song and singer
            updates will come from the web so internet assess is encouraged.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Linuxmint x64: <a href="./bsteeleMusicAppX64Linux.tgz" download>
            bsteeleMusicAppX64Linux.tgz</a>.
            After downloading, verify the sha256sum as:</p>
        <p>
            <span id="linuxSha256sum"> </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            This tar file needs to be extracted to a convenient directory on linux.
            Run the binary bsteele_music_flutter can be run there.
            Note that it requires the lib and data directories be in their relative positions.
            Tested on Linuxmint 20.3 Cinnamon OS on a x86-64 box.
            Song and singer
            updates will come from the web so internet assess is encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the application will automatically write the allSongPerformances file to the
            users home Download directory if the performances have been sung using the Singers
            screen and there has been roughly 45 minutes of no further action.
            This safety feature is not available in the web version.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Apache Tomcat war file (a Java web archive file):
        <a href="./bsteeleMusicApp.war" download>
            bsteeleMusicApp.war</a>.
        After downloading, verify the sha256sum as:</p>
        <p>
            <span id="warSha256sum"> </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The war file contents can also be extracted to a webserver (typically Apache)
            and served as static webpages without the leader/follower function.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>The application is written in Flutter and Dart. See <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>.
    The source code is available on github.com in three separate projects at:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/pearlbob/bsteele_music_flutter">bsteele_music_flutter</a>: This is the GUI
        section of the application written using the data model in the project bsteeleMusicLib. This split facilitates
        the logical division of functionality, provides a command line interface independent of flutter
        and increases the speed of testing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/pearlbob/bsteeleMusicLib">bsteeleMusicLib</a>:
        This is the data model support for the application. This project is intentionally strictly dart.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/pearlbob/bsteeleMusicServer">bsteeleMusicServer</a>:
        This is a small Tomcat9 server for the leader/follower feature. Note that it's not available for
        Tomcat10 and that it has been written in Java. The dart server interfaces do not easily allow cross
        websocket connection communication like the java one does.
    </li>

</ul>
<p>Technical Notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The build scripts in the bsteele_music_flutter/bin directory are tailored to my development environment
        and are not likely but be of much use otherwise. The projects should build and test properly
        from the usual flutter and dart command line interface.
    </li>
    <li>The bsteele_music_flutter/pubspec.yaml assumes that the bsteeleMusicLib project is in an
        adjacent directory.
    </li>
</ul>
